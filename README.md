## What's Up ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ningkun Zhou**, a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in computer vision and its applications in industrial and scientific settings.

### Education

I graduated from the **University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison**, with a major in **Genetics**ðŸ§¬ and a minor in **Computer Science**ðŸ’».

### Professional Experience

I currently work at **Danieli China**, where I develop the **Automatic Scrap Classification System**. My expertise lies in integrating state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms into production environments. Here are a few highlights of my work:

- **YOLO for Object Detection**: Implemented YOLO to detect electron magnets in scrap yards for fully automatic PTZ camera control.
- **Auto PTZ Camera Zoom**: Developed a system to automatically adjust PTZ camera zoom using cross-correlation techniques.
- **Zero-shot Image Classification**: Applied zero-shot image classification to reduce the need for annotated data.
- **Fine-tuned Mask R-CNN**: Fine-tuned Mask R-CNN for semantic segmentation tasks.

### Research Experience

Prior to my industry work, I spent three years in research, where I honed my computer vision skills and applied them to solve complex problems in protein structure analysis. My research contributions include:

- **K-means Clustering**: Utilized K-means for unsupervised clustering in protein structure analysis.
- **Fourier Transform**: Applied Fourier Transform techniques for data processing.
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Used semantic segmentation for particle refinement in structural biology.
- **Image Classification**: Developed image classification models for automated sample screening.

### Technical Skills

- **Computer Vision**: YOLO, Mask R-CNN, semantic segmentation, image classification
- **Algorithms**: K-means clustering, Fourier Transform, cross-correlation
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++, Java
- **Tools**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV

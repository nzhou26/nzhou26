### What's Up ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ningkun Zhou, a programmer with biology background. 

I graduated from the University Wisconsinâ€“Madison, majored in GeneticsðŸ§¬ and minored in Computer ScienceðŸ’».

I'm currently working for [Bioland Laboratory](https://www.grmh-gdl.cn/), Guangzhou.

I'm building some deep learning-based applications for [cryo-EM](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/explainer-what-is-cryo-electron-microscopy/3008091.article), including [cryoCheck](https://github.com/nzhou26/cryoCheck) and [particleSeg](https://github.com/nzhou26/particleSeg), attempting to improve data quality and processing efficiency. 

I'll never stop learning coding and mathematics behind it, because I believed coding is probably the only way to save humanity.

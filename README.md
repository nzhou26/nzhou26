# What's Up ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ningkun Zhou**, a Machine Learning Engineer with **5 year experience**, specializing in computer vision and its applications in industrial and scientific settings. I'm looking for jobs in the United Kingdom right now. 

## Professional Experience
### Danieli China
I currently work at **Danieli China**, where I **lead** the algorithm team and together we develop the **Automatic Scrap Classification System**. My expertise lies in integrating computer vision algorithms into production environments. Here are a few highlights of my work:
#### Scrap Yard Automatic Imaging

</p>

This image acquisition system I developed is fully automatic. Whenever a new layer of scrap exposed by the electromagnet, a detailed image will be acquired. 

- **YOLO for Object Detection**: Implemented YOLO to detect electron magnets in scrap yards for fully automatic PTZ camera image acquisition.
- **Auto PTZ Camera Zoom Calculation**: Developed an calibration algorithm to automatically adjust PTZ camera zoom factor using cross-correlation techniques.
#### Semantic Segmentation

</p>

- **Fine-tuned Mask R-CNN**: Fine-tuned Mask R-CNN for semantic segmentation for scrap metal.
- **Continuous Optimization**: Worked closely with customers, ensured 90% to 95% accuracies by vehicle. More than five projects have been accepted under my leadership. 
#### Other highlights
- **Zero-shot Image Classification**: Applied zero-shot image classification to reduce data annotation by 50%.
- **Image Search by Feature**: Developed a image search system based on contrastive loss to overcome annotation inaccuracy. 
- **Algorithm Deployment**: To deploy our algorithms, I utilized and mastered multiple communication frameworks, including RESTful API, SQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
## Research Experience

Prior to my industry work, I spent three years in research in the field of **Biomedical Imaging**, at Dr. Jun He's lab in [GIBH Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.gibh.cas.cn/), where I honed my computer vision skills and applied them to solve protein structure using Cryogenic Electron Microscopy. Here are my publications during my research years:

- Shuqi Dong, Huadong Li, **Ningkun Zhou**, et al. "Structural basis of nucleosome deacetylation and DNA linker tightening by Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex" *Cell Research*, 2023. [DOI: 10.1038/s41422-023-00869-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-023-00869-1)

- Le Tang, Shuqi Dong, **Ningkun Zhou**, et al. "Vibrio parahaemolyticus prey targeting requires autoproteolysis-triggered dimerization of the type VI secretion system effector RhsP" *Cell Reports*, 2022. [DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111732](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111732)

If your are not familiar with Cryo-EM, I contribute to these projects by:

- **Sample Preparation**: Rapidly freezing biological macromolecules in vitreous ice to preserve their native conformation, typically involving grid preparation, blotting, and plunge-freezing.
- **Data Collection**: Acquiring a series of high-resolution micrographs using a cryo-electron microscope, often with the aid of automated data collection software, such as Serial-EM and EPU, to capture multiple views of the protein sample.
- **Density Map Reconstruction**: Applying computational algorithms, which includes Fourier Transformation, K-Mean Clustering, Central Slice Theorem, to process the 2D projection images and reconstruct a high-resolution 3D density map of the specimen.
- **Atomic Model Building**: Fitting atomic coordinates into the 3D density map using model-building software like Coot and Phenix, enabling the interpretation of the macromolecular structure at the atomic level and facilitating the understanding of its functional mechanisms.
- **Innovative Approaches**: Integrated EffiecientNet in auto sample screening and U-Net for protein particle segmentation to improve resolution 

## Education

I graduated from the **University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison**, with a major in **Genetics**ðŸ§¬ and a minor in **Computer Science**ðŸ’».

## Technical Skills

- **Deep Learning**: EfficientNet, U-Net, YOLO, Mask R-CNN, ViT, CLIP
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash, Node.js
- **Packages**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Scipy, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Docker, Linux, Flask, RESTful API, RabbitMQ, Redis, SQL, Git

Feel free to explore my repositories. I'm open to work right now!

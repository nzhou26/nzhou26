### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ningkun Zhou, a programmer with biology background. Graduated from the University Wisconsin, Madison, I'm currently working for Bioland Laboratory, Guangzhou.

I'm building some deep learning-based applications for [cryo-EM](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/explainer-what-is-cryo-electron-microscopy/3008091.article), including [cryoCheck](https://github.com/nzhou26/cryoCheck) and [particleSeg](https://github.com/nzhou26/particleSeg), attempting to improve data quality and processing efficiency.

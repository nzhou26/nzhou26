## What's Up ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ningkun Zhou**, a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in computer vision and its applications in industrial and scientific settings.

### Education

I graduated from the **University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison**, with a major in **Genetics**ðŸ§¬ and a minor in **Computer Science**ðŸ’».

### Professional Experience

I currently work at **Danieli China**, where I lead the algorithm team and together we develop the **Automatic Scrap Classification System**. My expertise lies in integrating computer vision algorithms into production environments. Here are a few highlights of my work:

- **YOLO for Object Detection**: Implemented YOLO to detect electron magnets in scrap yards for fully automatic PTZ camera image acquisation.
- **Auto PTZ Camera Zoom Calculation**: Developed an calibration algorithm to automatically adjust PTZ camera zoom factor using cross-correlation techniques.
- **Zero-shot Image Classification**: Applied zero-shot image classification to reduce the need for annotated data.
- **Fine-tuned Mask R-CNN**: Fine-tuned Mask R-CNN for semantic segmentation for scrap metal.
- **Algorithm Deployment**: To deploy our algorithms, I utilized and mastered multiple communication frameworks, including RESTful API, SQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
### Research Experience

Prior to my industry work, I spent three years in research, work for Dr. Jun He's lab in [GIBH Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.gibh.cas.cn/), where I honed my computer vision skills and applied them to solve protein structure using Cryogenic Electron Microscopy. Here are my publications during my research years:

- Shuqi Dong, Huadong Li, **Ningkun Zhou**, et al. "Structural basis of nucleosome deacetylation and DNA linker tightening by Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex" *Cell Research*, 2023. [DOI: 10.1038/s41422-023-00869-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-023-00869-1)

- Le Tang, Shuqi Dong, **Ningkun Zhou**, et al. "Vibrio parahaemolyticus prey targeting requires autoproteolysis-triggered dimerization of the type VI secretion system effector RhsP" *Cell Reports*, 2022. [DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111732](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111732)

If your are not familiar with Cryo-EM, I contribute to these projects by:

- **Sample Preparation**: Rapidly freezing biological macromolecules in vitreous ice to preserve their native conformation, typically involving grid preparation, blotting, and plunge-freezing.
- **Data Collection**: Acquiring a series of high-resolution micrographs using a cryo-electron microscope, often with the aid of automated data collection software, such as Serial-EM and EPU, to capture multiple views of the protein sample.
- **Density Map Reconstruction**: Applying computational algorithms, which includes Fourier Transforma, K-Mean Clustering, Central Slice Theorem, to process the 2D projection images and reconstruct a high-resolution 3D density map of the specimen.
- **Atomic Model Building**: Fitting atomic coordinates into the 3D density map using model-building software like Coot and Phenix, enabling the interpretation of the macromolecular structure at the atomic level and facilitating the understanding of its functional mechanisms.
- **Innovative Approaches**: I integrated EffiecientNet in auto sample screening and U-Net for protein particle segmentaion to improve resolution 

### Technical Skills

- **Deep Learning**: EfficientNet, U-Net, YOLO, Mask R-CNN, ViT, CLIP
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash, Node.js
- **Packages**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Scipy, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Docker, Linux, Flask, RESTful API, RabbitMQ, Redis, SQL, Git

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my projects. I'm open to work right now!
